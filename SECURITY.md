# Security

The switcher handles Claude sign-in tokens, so security reports matter a lot here.

## Reporting a problem

Please **do not open a public issue.** Report it privately instead:
[Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/SnlperStripes/claude-account-switcher/security/advisories/new).

Include what you found, how to reproduce it, and which version you tested. You should get an answer within a week.

## What counts

Anything that could expose or misuse a saved sign-in, for example:

- Tokens or cookies written in plain text, logged, or sent anywhere other than `api.anthropic.com`
- Other users or programs on the machine being able to read the saved sign-ins more easily than Claude's own files
- A release binary that does not match its `.sha256` file or the source

## Supported versions

Only the latest release gets fixes.
